# Investigating a Relational Database
This project is to investigate and answer interesting questions about Sakila Movie database, an online DVD rental business. The aim of the project is to query the database and analyze results to answer questions about business decisions.

## Date Created

## Description

The database is queried to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance

The expected deliverables from the four queries are:
- a question of interest.
- a supporting SQL query to answer the question.
- a supporting visualization using the final data of the SQL query that answers the question of interest.

## The Database
The database is made up of 14 tables with a total of 64 columns.

Note: One anomaly with the database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007.
